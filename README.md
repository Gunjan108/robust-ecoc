This is the github repository for the paper "Error Correcting Output Codes Improve Probability Estimation and Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks"  by Gunjan Verma and Ananthram Swami.

All code is in Python 3.6. Adversarial attacks are done with CleverHans 3.0.1. The code is divided into 3 main files

1. AnalyzeModels.py.  
2. Model.py
3. Model_Implementations.py
